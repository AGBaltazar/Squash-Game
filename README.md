# Squash Game - Phaser Project
Welcome to the Squash Game (Based off everyones favorite Heeler)! This is a simple web-based game inspired by the Bluey episode on squash, built using Phaser, a powerful JavaScript game framework. The game is designed to showcase fundamental JavaScript concepts while leveraging Phaser's capabilities to create a fun and interactive experience.

# Project Overview
In this project, we will focus on the basics of JavaScript to create the core gameplay mechanics. Our goal is to keep the project lightweight, beginner-friendly, and easy to understand for developers with a basic understanding of JavaScript.

# Key elements include:

Simple 2D Game: Using Phaser to create fast-rendering 2D visuals.
Interactive Buttons: Implementing clickable buttons to navigate through scenes (e.g., Start Game, Options).
Basic Game Physics: Simple ball and player movement using Phaser’s physics engine.
JavaScript Fundamentals: Emphasizing core JavaScript concepts like functions, event listeners, and basic scene management.
Tech Stack
Phaser: JavaScript game framework for 2D games.
JavaScript (Vanilla): Core language for game logic and interactions.
HTML5 / CSS3: For the basic structure and styling of the game page.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

# Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/bluey-squash-game.git
cd bluey-squash-game
Install Dependencies: This project uses basic JavaScript and does not require complex setup. Simply download and open the HTML file in a browser.

# Run the Game: Open index.html in any modern browser to see the game in action.

# Game Structure
The project is structured around scenes and basic game mechanics. Here's an outline:

Main Menu: The player can start the game or adjust settings.
Play Scene: The core gameplay, where players hit the ball in a squash-like game.
Options Menu: Adjust settings like volume, difficulty, etc.
Game Over Screen: Shown when the game ends, with options to restart or return to the menu.
Key JavaScript Concepts Used
This project focuses on fundamental JavaScript concepts, such as:

Event Listeners: Adding interactivity through user input (e.g., clicking buttons).
Functions: Modularizing game logic into small, reusable functions.
Scene Management: Managing different game states like Main Menu, Play Scene, etc.
Basic Game Loops: Using Phaser's update() function to continuously render the game.
Example of Scene Flow:
Main Menu → Start the game or adjust options.
Play Scene → Handle player input, ball movement, and scoring.
Game Over → Show the final score and offer options to restart or return to the menu.
Why Basic JavaScript?
This project is designed with simplicity in mind. By focusing on the basics of JavaScript, we aim to:

Keep the game logic straightforward and accessible to beginner developers.
Avoid overwhelming complexity, making it easier to learn and contribute to the project.
Build a solid foundation for those who want to learn JavaScript through game development.
